### Hi there, I'm Sergios!

🌱 I'm a part-time Software Engineer at **Intel**.

🎓 I graduated from the **University of Bath** with a first-class honours BSc Computer Science degree.

🔬 For my dissertation, I developed an any-time and any-space, sparse-sensing SLAM system for low-cost robotics platforms.

📚 I enjoy working with C++, Java and Python and I'm fascinated by robotics, embedded systems and low-level programming!

👨‍💻 If you'd like to take a look at some of my more _interesting_ projects, I'd suggest any of the following:
- [Insight](https://github.com/alex-and-the-antelopes/Insight), a Parliamentary Bill tracker
- [EV3Rover](https://github.com/sg2295/EV3Rover), a non-holonomic, differential drive vehicle facilitating environment exploration and data acquisition
- [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/sg2295/Sudoku-Solver), an agent that can solve Sudoku puzzles
- [Instant Messenger](https://github.com/sg2295/InstantMessenger), a Client-Server chat system using Sockets and Threads
- [Wheelie](https://github.com/sg2295/Wheelie), an RC car based on the communication between two Arduinos

🏆 I've had the opportunity to participate in a few hackathons and programming competitions:
- Won ___Most Technically Impressive___ at Bath Hack, 2023
- Won ___1st Place___ at BAE System's Capture The Flag at the University of Bath, 2022
- Won ___Most Impressive___ and voted ___2nd Hackers Choice___ at Bath Hack, 2021
- Won ___Best Overall___ at Launchpad 5.0, 2021
- Won ___Most likely to lead the robot uprising___ at the University of Bath Systems Architecture Competition, 2019
