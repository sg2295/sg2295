### Hi there, I'm Sergios!

🌱 I just finished my second year of Computer Science at the University of Bath and I'm about to begin a 13-month placement at Intel.

📚 I’m currently trying to learn more about C and C++.

👨‍💻 If you'd like to take a look at some of my more _interesting_ projects, I'd suggest any of the following:
- [Insight](https://github.com/alex-and-the-antelopes/Insight), a Parliamentary Bill tracker
- [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/sg2295/Sudoku-Solver), an agent that can solve Sudoku puzzles
- [Instant Messenger](https://github.com/sg2295/InstantMessenger), a Client-Server chat system using Sockets and Threads
- [Wheelie](https://github.com/sg2295/Wheelie), an RC car based on the communication between two Arduinos

🏆 I've had the opportunity to participate in a few hackathons and programming competitions:
- Won ___Most likely to lead the robot uprising___ at University of Bath Systems Architecture Competition, 2019
- Won ___Best Overall___ at Launchpad 5.0, 2021
- Won ___Most Impressive___ and voted ___2nd Hacker's Choice___ at Bath Hack, 2021
